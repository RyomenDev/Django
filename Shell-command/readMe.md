###     Running the Scripts
Save each script as a .sh file.
Make them executable:
```
sh
chmod +x method1_run_as_admin.sh
chmod +x method2_user_option.sh
chmod +x method3_fix_deleteme.sh
chmod +x method4_virtual_env.sh
chmod +x method5_reinstall_python.sh
```
Run the desired script:
```
sh
./method1_run_as_admin.sh
```
Each script includes verification commands at the end to ensure Django and its components are correctly installed. Let me know if you need adjustments!
